I'm a lone sloth living in a cruel city. I spend my days
lounging around the den with my feet up and a good ole
claw full of munchies. Today started like any other.
I climbed from my bed to the kitchen in search of a
nice cup of tea and... No this has to be wrong.
I was certain I had gotten a third box of donuts yesterday.
Something has to be done.

Should I try to leave so early in the morning? By noon I could have donuts in hand...
1. Eat something else with tea
2. Leave the house and search for donuts
