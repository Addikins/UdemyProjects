  storyText: "I am a sloth, and therefore patience is my virtue. I wait until the
    tea hits the perfect temperature. Slowly, as I tend to make a habit of, I enjoy
    it down to the last drop. The tea was delightful, but now I feel my tummy grumbling
    and I must find a way to fill this never ending hunger which torments my soul
    down to the very fiber of my slothness.\r\n\r\nThere still might be time to get
    some munchies...\r\n1. Go back to bed\r\n2. Make a crawl to for the donuts"
