  storyText: "I remember when I was young, hanging from the treetops with my friends,
    not a care in the world. Life gets tough when you lose your cuddly exterior. Now
    all I've got are my snacks and my aloof nature. Speaking of which... Well, I doubt
    I have the energy to climb back down anyhow. I think I'll just let some moss germinate
    on me and become one with nature again.\r\n\r\n1. Germinate\r"
