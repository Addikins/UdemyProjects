  storyText: "I'm a lone sloth living in a cruel city. I spend my days\r lounging
    around the den with my feet up and a good ole\r claw full of munchies. Today started
    like any other.\r I climbed from my bed to the kitchen in search of a\r nice cup
    of tea and... No this has to be wrong.\r I was certain I had gotten a third box
    of donuts yesterday. Something has to be done.\r\n\r\nShould I try to leave so
    early in the morning? By noon I could have donuts in hand...\r\n1. Have the tea
    without donuts\r\n2. Leave the house and search for donuts"
