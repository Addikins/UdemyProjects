  storyText: "In the shed there are many tools, a broom, a mop, and the usual things
    any sane sloth would find useless. There's two chests nestled in the small shed.
    One is a white chest sitting in the corner, boring but familiar. The other is
    an elegant chest with a gold trim resembling pirate's treasure.\r\n\r\nWhich chest
    should I search?\r\n1. The White Chest\r\n2. The Elegant Chest"
