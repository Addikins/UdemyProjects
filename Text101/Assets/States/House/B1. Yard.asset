  storyText: "I head out in search of delicious pastries so that I can start my day
    off right. As I'm leaving I encounter an enormous oak tree nestled firmly in my
    yard. It's so large in fact, that I am quiet frankly outstanding that I haven't
    encountered this specimen until now.\r\n\r\nMy instincts tell me to climb, but
    there are donuts at stake here...\r\n1. Give into the urge to climb\r\n2. Fight
    the urge and search the shed"
