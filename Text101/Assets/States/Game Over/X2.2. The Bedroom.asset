  storyText: "I shamble my way to bed, hungry and uneasy about my rough day. As I
    poke my head in, I realize that I brought the third package of donuts into the
    room with me and proceeded to go into a food coma. Perhaps all I needed to do
    was sleep in a little later. The lesson here is that I really shouldn't put so
    much effort into my day, I am a sloth after all. Now, time to sink my worries
    into these fluffy pastries.\r\n\r\nNow that I've gotten my snacks I'm good to
    go, but I can always try to get more grub...\r\n1. Play Again\r\n2. Exit Game"
